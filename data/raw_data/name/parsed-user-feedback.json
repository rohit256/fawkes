Some improvements would be things like connecting Venmo automatically and connecting cash income to your net worth. Right now you have to connect Venmo manually even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s using the same bank card you already have connected to mint. I was confused when none of my bills were showing up because I pay them through Venmo. And having your money in the bank displayed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is a little confusing as well. I think it should be called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153banking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or something other than cash. Lastly, it would be nice to be able to keep track of our actual cash(paper money) more easily for things like tips."

After awhile you learn to just ignore the ads, they are not terribly intrusive. \nHowever, there are still some really irritating features to Mint. About every other time I access I get \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Incorrect User name or password\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd message. I then reenter the same same info as always and it goes through. The set up budget feature is way overly complex, but doable if your willing to spend the time and energy (so much for automatic time saver concept).  I still have not been able to figure how to add my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts so that we get a household picture. Mint just cannot seem to understand we could have two credit cards from the same institution with two different access points. I am also still struggling on how to track cash expenditures; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s there I just cannot understand how to do it."

The main bug was that transactions were showing up twice, so that made Mint too hard to use as I was having to manually hide multiple transactions a week. \n\nLast week, I decided to try it again. This time all my ACCOUNTS are showing up twice. Not, transactions - entire accounts.  When I go to the account list, every account is listed twice. No more Mint for me. I hate it bc, when it works, it\u2019s a great money and budgeting app. Unfortunately, it just never works."

Credit Card charges and strange fees that DISCOVER doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell me about, but Mint catches them. \n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened a few times now. Then I call and sort it out with Discover or my bank. \n\nGreat visuals. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to keep track of your money when your spending looks like 1 long receipt that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gotta type into a calculator. \n\nMint opts for the colored wheel, pie graph type of chart. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clean, it recognizes different stores as the right categories well. Easy to go into a subcategory (Shopping) and see what you were doing that month."

However, noticing that it recently had several issues connecting with my 401k provider and refreshing properly RobinHood account data, I decided to try out Mint. So far, the experience has been great as both accounts linking and syncing has worked flawlessly. EXCEPT:\n1- One issue... when linking RobinHood, despite correctly adding both my investment account value and the cash management account value, it computes the investment value incorrectly: since it adds to it the cash account balance. Basically, the cash management account balance is counted TWICE! \n2- I was amazed by how flawlessly Mint shows me transaction history for stock purchases. So, why not computing this into a graph that shows progress of financial growth over time? Net worth data unfortunately only starts from the day I register my account and connect the institutions of relevance. And it would be just amazing if the app could pull past data and logging that too!\n\nHoping for this to get fixed (item 1-) to update my review to 5/5 :)",

However, noticing that it recently had several issues connecting with my 401k provider and refreshing properly RobinHood account data, I decided to try out Mint. So far, the experience has been great as both accounts linking and syncing has worked flawlessly. EXCEPT:\n1- One issue... when linking RobinHood, despite correctly adding both my investment account value and the cash management account value, it computes the investment value incorrectly: since it adds to it the cash account balance. Basically, the cash management account balance is counted TWICE! \n2- I was amazed by how flawlessly Mint shows me transaction history for stock purchases. So, why not computing this into a graph that shows progress of financial growth over time? Net worth data unfortunately only starts from the day I register my account and connect the institutions of relevance. And it would be just amazing if the app could pull past data and logging that too!\n\nHoping for this to get fixed (item 1-) to update my review to 5/5 :)"

It would be nice if future month\u2019s budgets could be set up in advance instead of waiting until the 1st day of the month to adjust the budget category amounts.\n\n3. The ability to edit/add budget categories would be real nice.

I use it everyday and multiple times throughout the day as my family spends money and track how we are doing. I could give it 5 stars if the following could be addressed:\n\n1. The app doesn\u2019t always sync/refresh with my Beacon Credit Union account. If I want up-to-date information I have to manually re-add Beacon back into the app.\n\n2. It would be nice if future month\u2019s budgets could be set up in advance instead of waiting until the 1st day of the month to adjust the budget category amounts.\n\n3. The ability to edit/add budget categories would be real nice. I often find that my expenditures don\u2019t fit the fixed categories the app has.\n\nI would be willing to pay for this app if the above changes could be incorporated."
