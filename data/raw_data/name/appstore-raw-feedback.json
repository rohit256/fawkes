I like that my accounts update immediately after I sign in.  I Love that it is free and can be used on multiple platforms.  \n\nBut there are issues, and I doubt they will EVER be FIXED.\n\n1.  Even when I have mint memorize transactions, it never does because of a slight flaw in the uploading process.\n2.  I do not want alerts sent to me or on the accounts.  So what do I get?  Alerts!!  Mint does not need to tell me that I have a high spending alert on my house payment every month.  Its not even high.  Or tell me that my bank charged me a fee even though the bank reversed the fee each time.  Or get this, you had a large deposit (paycheck), duh I know how much my paycheck is.\n3.  How many times to I need to correct a transaction before it will stay corrected?  Four times is too many times to re-fix a transaction that should have been Memorized in the first place, (see number 1)."

That net worth number on the home screen is great - makes me want to keep saving.

I chatted with a customer service rep, and basically said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yeah that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an issue, just go off the number on your phone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve referred folk to this app and will continue to do so."

This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really the app but the service in general\n\n2) I constantly get the exact same push notifications. For the last 3 days, I get a push notification and the only thing new is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you went over the personal care budget by $10\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

I wish, however, it allowed for more customization for budgets, so that it can be easily used for both simple users and complex users. \n\nWhat I wish the most from this app was to budget by paycheck, but the only option was monthly budgeting. I am a college student, so it is difficult to budget per month, when expenses change constantly and so does income. \n\nI am going to continue to use this to see if I get used to it\u2019s layout bc the app is really good in almost all aspects, but I wish it offered different ways to view and plan budgets according to the user\u2019s personal preference. I have a pretty simple budget plan, but the app makes it much more complex for me. \n\nI like the way each transaction has a category\u2014as most budget systems do\u2014 but I wish it was left blank, so that I can customize each transaction myself, instead of having to choose from a list. Maybe it would be better to have the list as an option rather than the only way to categorize each transaction. I think that will make the app a lot more user friendly. Make it a search bar with suggested categories instead of definitive choices. ***And allow for CUSTOM INPUTS.*** Also, add a \u201cSUBSCRIPTION\u201d category!!"

However getting a full update can (still) take some time and several tries. Or not happen at all. Also, since 2/20, investment activity clutters the Transaction summary page (iPad version, not desktop). I spent many hours with Support and learned that this is a deliberate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the 2/20 update. Net net, for me, the Transactions summary is unusable, so I need to review and categorize transactions for each of my accounts separately. Still, Mint has served me well over a decade, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sticking with it. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not happy."

Additionally, several institutions aren't \"playing nice\" with Mint, so I can't access those accounts through this program. \n\nIt does a pretty good job of correctly identifying transactions (e.g. Restaurant transactions and gas purchases showing up in the appropriate budget categories) much better than BOA's account manager. \n\nI REALLY wish the debt payoff functionality worked better. You know my credit cards and debt accounts since they are linked. Would be great if it could give me tips for paying it off faster via avalanche method and snowflakes, and adjust if I use an account to make a purchase.\n\nOverall, I like it and use it. Just wish some of the functionality could be improved. Would then give 5 stars."

You need to use the desktop to app to do some other things with transactions\n4. \"Goals\" feature requires you save money in a checking/savings account for a single goal.\n5. Budgeting is simplistic. Only tracks spend. Can't allocate money towards a budget ahead of time like with YNAB.\n\nOverall\n1. It's free. You should definitely set up mint to track your spend history. It does a great job at that.\n2. It has simple tools for budgeting. That might meet your needs, but if you want to get serious use YNAB or another tool."

Mint helped me so much with organizing, alerting, and budgeting.\nI think the only issue is the billing-calender linkage. Sometimes somehow the setting gets turned off on its own. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much of an issue as long I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m familiar with the billing cycle, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super helpful if I can see all of the billing dates in one calendar without having it turned off. \nOne suggestion I would LOVE Mint to have is to let us create our own custom expense category. Out of all of my food expenses, I feel like I spend a lot on boba milk tea and I could of budget solely on that luxury. Even store-based category could be helpful, because I might be spending too much on Starbucks compare to other inexpensive coffee shops. The app is overall the best and simply aesthetic, but I wish I could make a custom category expense so I can monitor myself better."

I m showing g I spent way more in a category than I actually spent.  This is messing up my budgeting it pushing me over budget and I am not.  For example, I have actually spent close to $60 in Gas yet that budget bar reads I have spent $80.  The calculator for that field is off and also on Groceries I spent $40 and I am showing over $100 spent.  Please fix!\n\nNever experienced these issues previously and it goes unresolved for too long.  Very leery of what Mint\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capabilities are now.  Can you fix?  Updating accounts takes forever, the bills section on the second landing page disappears from time to time.  The Cashflow section was changed (see below) to something useless\nto me from it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original format.  Asked\nTime and again to be changed back, but nothing.  I must say, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maybe time to look for another budgeting app.  Been with Mint since 2012, would hate to leave...it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been working and I used to live this app.  Now this too much going wrong and remaining unfixed days without number.  \n\nPrevious Review still here:\nWhere is the Original Monthly Cashflow\n\nYou need to bring back the original Monthly Cashflow section.  Remove the graphs and bring back ALL transactions sorted by category and sorted by merchant.  You brought back an abbreviated version that does not include any income - BIG MISTAKE!   This section only works properly with each and every transaction we make!!!\n\nTake Action!!  Fix this!\nIt is NOT for spending alone.  You must have  all cashflow (incoming & outgoing).   Incoming like every paycheck, deposit, manual income and every debit from the accounts manual or otherwise.  Therefore, it cannot remain in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Monthly Spending\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section as the original was never just for spending only.  BRING back the original monthly cashflow section !!!  IT IS TIME!!!  FIX THIS!!!!!!!! \n\nPS. .  You added back some income but left out so much more.  You need the original program for that section before the fatal update a couple of months ago.  Just cut and paste and relocate it back to the cashflow section!  We know it was a colossal mistake now please fix it!!!"

However, noticing that it recently had several issues connecting with my 401k provider and refreshing properly RobinHood account data, I decided to try out Mint. So far, the experience has been great as both accounts linking and syncing has worked flawlessly. EXCEPT:\n1- One issue... when linking RobinHood, despite correctly adding both my investment account value and the cash management account value, it computes the investment value incorrectly: since it adds to it the cash account balance. Basically, the cash management account balance is counted TWICE! \n2- I was amazed by how flawlessly Mint shows me transaction history for stock purchases. So, why not computing this into a graph that shows progress of financial growth over time? Net worth data unfortunately only starts from the day I register my account and connect the institutions of relevance. And it would be just amazing if the app could pull past data and logging that too!\n\nHoping for this to get fixed (item 1-) to update my review to 5/5 :)"

No other transactions within the month have been placed in this category and nothing I can see add up to it. This also hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been set up to roll-over the balance.\n\nUpdate (12-03-19):\nImprovement with last update, but transactions still occasionally revert back to non-selected categories; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kinda random. A little frustrating.\n\nAlso seem to lose connection with Third Federal Savings and have to reconnect on a daily basis. Not sure if this is MINT or Third Federal, but I notice this on two separate accounts, two separate users.\n\nOld Review\nCheck your end of month transactions. My Oct 31 charges show in the transaction area, but not in the respective budget category (Oct or Nov). However, it does add up correctly in the Oct budget category.\n\nOverall, this is a solid app. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had bugs through the years that have been fixed, but new bugs pop up. But as I said, overall a solid app."

Several times now I've caught fraudulent charges before a stolen card number got used too much.\n\n2) With custom tags, I'm able to get totals for how much we spent on each grandchild, car, gifts etc.\n\n3) Most importantly, each year I get an instant total of my specially tagged health expenditures to use in my taxes.\n\nSometimes a bug sneaks in, but it's usually fixed soon after you report it.  (It used to be easier, with a few clicks, but now you have to chat with someone.)\n\nOverall, highly recommended!"
